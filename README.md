# Clubhouse GIF Reaction Project

This project allows you to react to Clubhouse rooms with GIFs using their WebAPI!

## Getting Started

To get started

with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2

. **PIP**: Ensure you have PIP installed. PIP typically comes installed with Python, but you can check by running `pip --version` in your terminal. If not installed, you can follow the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### Installation

3. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clubhouse-gif-reaction.git
    ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```

### Usage

6. Run the main script:
    ```sh
    python Main.py

7. You'll be prompted to enter your Clubhouse session ID. You can find this by logging into [Clubhouse](https://www.clubhouse.com/signin), opening the Developer Console (F12), and finding the session ID in the Network tab after refreshing the page.

8. Once you've entered your session ID, the script will start running, allowing you to react to Clubhouse rooms with GIFs!
